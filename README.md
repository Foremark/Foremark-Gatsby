# GatsbyJS plugins for Foremark

## TODO

- The ESLint rule `no-unused-expressions` fails for compiled code. Currently, a GatsbyJS project's `.eslintrc.json` should be updated with the following content: `{ "rules": { "no-unused-expressions": "off" } }`
- Make a starter project
- Find a better way to convert between Preact and React
